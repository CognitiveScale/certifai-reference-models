# Cortex Certifai Reference Models

This Repo contains code to train reference Machine Learning models for Cortex Certifai and create routes to expose the corresponding predict functionality of the trained models as routes via web services

All models are trained, exposed as web-service and containerized using source-to-image [s2i](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image
